# PASSWORD-MANAGER-PROJECT
Design and implement a Password Manager application in C++ that securely stores and manages user passwords for various accounts. The Password Manager should provide a secure environment for users to store their passwords, usernames, associated websites, and categories.
The Password Manager application aims to address the growing need for users to manage their numerous account credentials securely. The primary objective is to create a user-friendly, secure, and efficient system for storing, organizing, retrieving, and managing passwords. The application will offer functionalities including but not limited to:
1.  User Authentication: 
   - Users can log in using a master password or sign up for a new account.
   - After unsuccessful login attempts, users can use a security question to access their account.
2.  Password Management: 
   - Store passwords associated with websites, usernames, and categories.
   - Implement a secure data structure (like a hash table) for efficient password storage and retrieval.
3.  User Interface: 
   - Implement a user-friendly command-line or graphical user interface (GUI).
   - Provide options for users to add new passwords, view existing passwords, edit passwords, filter passwords based on categories, and generate random passwords.
4.  Data Storage: 
   - Use file handling to store user account information and passwords securely in a file.
   - Ensure data persistence between sessions to maintain user passwords and information.
5.  Password Strength Verification: 
   - Check the strength of passwords entered by users.
   - Implement rules for strong passwords (length, complexity, avoidance of common patterns).
FUTURE SCOPE
Cross-Platform Compatibility:  Extend the application's compatibility to support a broader range of operating systems and platforms. Develop versions for mobile devices (iOS, Android) to cater to a wider user base.
Biometric Authentication:  Implement biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint or facial recognition for enhanced security and ease of access.
Cloud Integration:  Integrate cloud storage options (like Google Drive, Dropbox) to allow users to sync and access their encrypted password data across multiple devices securely.
Enhanced Encryption Algorithms:  Explore and integrate more advanced encryption algorithms or techniques to further enhance password security and protect user data from evolving security threats.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):  Incorporate support for two-factor authentication methods, offering an additional layer of security by requiring a secondary verification step for accessing stored passwords.
Password Sharing and Collaboration:  Develop functionality for securely sharing passwords between trusted users or teams, allowing for collaboration without compromising security.
Backup and Recovery Options:  Provide automated backup options for encrypted password data to prevent data loss. Implement recovery mechanisms in case of accidental deletion or system failure.
Password Generator Enhancements:  Enhance the password generation feature by allowing users to specify custom criteria like character sets, length, and pronounceability for generated passwords.
User Interface Improvements:  Continuously improve the user interface based on user feedback, ensuring a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.
Continued development and innovation in these areas would enhance the Password Manager's functionality, security, and usability, making it an even more indispensable tool for users to securely manage their passwords in an increasingly digital world.
